			relational operators:

-eq if the values of two operands are equal then condition becomes true

'expr [ $a -eq $b ]

-ne -- not equals
if the value of two operands are not equal then condition becomes true or false 

'expr [ $a -ne $b ]'

-gt -- greater than

if the value of left operand is greater than right operand condition becomes true.
'expr [ $a -gt $b ]'

-lt -- less than
if the value of left operand is less than right operand condition becomes true.
'expr [ $a -lt $b ]'

-ge -- greater than or equals
if the value of left operand is greater than or equals to right operand condition becomes true.
'expr [ $a -ge $b ]'

-le -- less than or equals
if the value of left operand is less than or equals to right operand then condition becomes true.
'expr [ $a -le $b ]'

df -h | head -2 | grep / | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f5 | sed 's/%//'

! this inverts a true condition into false and a false condition into true..
[!true]
[!false]

-o logical OR
any condition must be true
[ cnd1 -o cnd 2]
[ $a -eq $b -o $a -gt $b ]

-a logical AND
both conditions must be true -- if both operands are true then condition become true else false..
a=10
b=20
[ $a -eq $b -o $a -gt $b ] -- true
[ $b -gt $a -a $a -lt $b ] -- true
